This is a python notebook where i experimented multiple algorithm such as naive bayes, random forest and descision tree to predict the best crop based on some features. I understood how to make a model using sklearn, also implemented a naive bayes classifier from scratch. I watched youtube tutorials to understand the mathematical concept behind this algorithm. This was part of our semester one maths project. It taught me how to clean, visualise, split dataframes.
